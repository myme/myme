- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Martin!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in [nix](https://nixos.org) ecosystem and functional programming in [Haskell](https://haskell.org), but I mostly do professional work in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve been currently learning a bit of [rust-lang](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
- ðŸ“« Reach out to me through the footer links on my home page: https://myme.no.
