- 👋 Hi, I’m Martin!
- 👀 I’m interested in [nix](https://nixos.org) ecosystem and functional programming in [Haskell](https://haskell.org), but I mostly do professional work in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- 🌱 I’ve been currently learning a bit of [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [go](https://go.dev/).
- 📫 Reach out to me through the footer links on my home page: https://myme.no.
